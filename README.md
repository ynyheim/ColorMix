# OrangeMix

This is OrangeMix, a dark color theme based on the color orange.

The reasoning behind this color theme is summarized in [Designing OrangeMix](doc/designing-color-themes.md). Please see [Enhancing code readability in Code](doc/enhancing-code-readability-in-code.md) for more tips on improving code readability in Code.

## Language support

> Most formatting rules in the theme are language independent and should work as long as Code has grammar support for the specified language.

The theme has been used in active development using

- **Source Code:** C#, C++, C, Typescript, JavaScript, SQL, MSIL
- **Configuration/Data:** XML, HTML, CSS, JSON, YAML, JSX
- **Text:** Markdown

## Contributing

**Happy coding!**
